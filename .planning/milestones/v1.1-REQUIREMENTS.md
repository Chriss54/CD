## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| AI-powered search | High cost/complexity, standard search sufficient for community scale |
| Voice search | Browser provides this natively |
| Image/visual search | Different domain, not applicable to community content |
| Boolean syntax (AND/OR/NOT) | 99% of users won't use it, adds parsing complexity |
| Real-time search results | Unnecessary complexity, results refresh on new search |
| Search result export | Niche need, potential data scraping vector |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| SRCH-01 | Phase 12 | Complete |
| SRCH-02 | Phase 12 | Complete |
| SRCH-03 | Phase 12 | Complete |
| SRCH-04 | Phase 13 | Complete |
| SRCH-05 | Phase 13 | Complete |
| SRCH-06 | Phase 13 | Complete |
| SRCH-07 | Phase 13 | Complete |
| SRCH-08 | Phase 13 | Complete |
| SRCH-09 | Phase 12 | Complete |
